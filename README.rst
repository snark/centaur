Centaur: A Planet-like pluggable feed aggregator
================================================

Centaur is a Python library and associated command-line application for 
manipulating and aggregating feeds, particularly for taking a list of Atom and
RSS sources and turning them into a single source.  Entries can be filtered in
a variety of ways; you could, for instance, monitor a high-volume site like
MetaFilter or Reddit, picking out only entries associated with keywords which
interest you.

The inspirations for Centaur are chiefly `Planet <https://github.com/python/planet>`_,
the venerable Python feed aggregator (and `Venus <https://github.com/rubys/venus>`_,
a later rewrite of Planet), and `Reblog <https://github.com/movabletype/mt-plugin-reblog>`_,
a plugin for the Movable Type CMS.
