A Planet-like pluggable feed aggregator

Centaur is a Python library and command-line tool for taking a list of Atom and
RSS feeds and aggregating them into a single feed. Entries can be filtered in
a variety of ways; you could, for instance, monitor a high-volume site like
MetaFilter or Reddit, picking out only feeds associated with keywords you're
interested in.
